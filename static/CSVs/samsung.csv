"Samsung Galaxy S9 (Midnight Black, 64 GB)",Narendra Singh Rathore,24999.0,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Best ever samsung s series mobile phone. S8 is also definitely better but S9 have some advantages 1) Speed either it can reading writing to internal storage or opening apps. 2) Dual speaker setup, it's totally awesome, far better than any samsung s series device. 3) Dual aperture rear camera which have 4k 60 fps, 1080 240 fps and 720 960 fps video recording capability. 4) Little bit better in design also. Rest i believe is same as s8. Don't expect best battery life from it, sometimes i have t..."

"Samsung Galaxy S9 (Midnight Black, 64 GB)",Samarth Bhardwaj,24999.0,5,Perfect product!,"First let me give you all the physical overview...The handset looks awesome in the hands,having the glass back(though it attracts fingerprints)Now let's talk about the cons: 1.  Battery Backup __ It'll last a typical working day(i.e. around 16-18 hours of normal usage) 2.  Infinity Screen __ No tempered glass can be fitted...So it makes it even more fragile!!Now time for the pros: Everything about the phone is a PRO feature!!!!

"Samsung Galaxy S9 (Midnight Black, 64 GB)",arun kumar,24999.0,5,Looks best!Performance better! Battery OK!,After one month of usage I am writing this review! Design : compact for a 5.8 inch phone. It's a pleasure to handle this phone. The curved screen is gorgeous! Performance : since it has top notch specs the performance is very good!I would be happier if they have given 6gb ram! Camera: low light performance is really good because of f1.5 Battery: it lasts a full day with average use. Got screen on time of 6 to 7 hrs. It's OK for  a flagship product

"Samsung Galaxy S9 (Midnight Black, 64 GB)",Harish Benjwal ,24999.0,4,Delightful,The reason behind getting galaxy s9 was it's capability of low light photography as that is always has been a challenge for me. So I went ahead after testing galaxy s7 and LG g7 thinq in the past. And the mobile performs. The display is always a treat to look at. One can go for Galaxy S9 plus if portraits is his/her forte. Rest it's all about creative angles and composition.

"Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus (Midnight Black, 64 GB)",Vivek Bhore,30999.0,5,Best in the market!,"Awesome phone under 30k budget.Ultimate quadHD display experience. Best thing is rear camera. I m already owning A50s with so called 48MP camera. A50s is nothing compared to this phone. Camera dynamic range is huge. You get complete details like trees, buldings etc very neatly. Macro shots are also awesome. Night shots are exceptional. Only wide angle lens missing. But its no big deal.Triple or four camera setup on recent budget phones like A50, A51, A70 is fake. Its marketing gimmick. So ..."
